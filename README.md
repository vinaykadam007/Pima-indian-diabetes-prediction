# Project Title: Pima Indian Diabetes Prediction Model
This GitHub project hosts a predictive model for determining whether an individual is likely to have diabetes based on a dataset containing key health metrics. The dataset comprises four columns: Glucose concentration from an oral test within 2 hours, Insulin levels within 2 hours, Age of the person, and an Outcome label indicating the presence or absence of diabetes (0 for No Diabetes and 1 for Diabetes).

## Task
The primary goal of this project is to build and evaluate predictive models that can accurately predict the likelihood of diabetes using two out of the three available features: Glucose, Insulin, and Age. Through the use of machine learning algorithms, we aim to empower healthcare professionals and individuals with a tool that can assist in early diabetes detection, leading to more proactive health management and improved overall well-being.

## Key Features
### Dataset Exploration: 
We provide comprehensive data exploration and analysis to gain insights into the characteristics of the dataset.
### Feature Selection: 
You can experiment with different combinations of the three features (Glucose, Insulin, and Age) to determine which pair results in the most accurate predictions.
### Model Building: 
We offer a variety of machine learning algorithms and techniques for building predictive models, allowing you to compare their performance.
### Model Evaluation: 
We provide robust evaluation metrics to assess the performance of your chosen model(s) and help you make informed decisions.
### Visualization: 
Visualize the data, model performance, and results to gain a deeper understanding of the predictions.
